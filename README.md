# SecurePass
### Open-Source Password Manager for your
SecurePass is free open-source password manager with cool design and password generator. 
Just remember one key, using a lot of passwords.

Now, we're developing our application. 
And after every update we improve it.

### Why SecurePass is a good password manager?
We do what we ourselves use. Our project was created for people who do not want to pay money for software that may have backdoors.

Once we add security enhancements, your data will be stored encrypted and completely secure.
